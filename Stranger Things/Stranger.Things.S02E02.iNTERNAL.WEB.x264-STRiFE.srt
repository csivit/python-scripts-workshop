What if they come looking for her?

They don't know where she is.

you must tell us.

You know the rules.

who have had these things,

162
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,691
and it feels like you're there,
like it's happening.

163
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,820
- Then what the hell is this?
- Owens said it would get worse.

164
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,405
- That place...
- What do you wanna do?

165
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,032
You wanna take him back to Chicago?

166
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,118
Well, there's that guy in Boston
that's supposed to be...

167
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,537
They're all a bunch of quacks.

168
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,248
They'll all tell you the same thing,
just cost you more money.

169
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:59,088
I think he's right... about trauma.
And we're coming up on a year, you know.

170
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,968
I think everybody's on edge.
Me, you... Will most of all.

171
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,430
I think we just gotta get through
the next few weeks.

172
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,182
[sighs]

173
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,226
[sighs]

174
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,145
Nothing's gonna go back
to the way that it was.

175
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,730
Not really.

176
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,190
But it'll get better.

177
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,360
In time.

178
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,824
[sighs heavily]

179
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,033
[Joyce mumbles]

180
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,702
- Here.
- Thank you.

181
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,539
- [chokes and coughs]
- [chuckles]

182
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
Jesus! Hopper...

183
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,043
Brings me back to old times.

184
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,086
What?

185
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,591
- [sighs] Sharing my cigarettes between...
- Fifth and sixth period.

186
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,759
Yeah, under the steps.

187
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,970
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?

188
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,472
He was like,
[gruffly] "Hey, assholes."

189
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,392
We ran. We just ran.

190
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,144
[chuckles]

191
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,449
God, I want this to be over.

192
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,409
I know.

193
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:13,996
[Joyce sniffles]

194
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,470
[beeps]

195
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,576
[static crackling]

196
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,209
How's it looking out there, cowboy?

197
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,962
[man] Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.

198
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,756
Nice and nasty
with a chance of radioactivity.

199
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:21,188
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right.
Anyone hungry?

200
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,944
[technician] And...

201
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,655
[beeping]

202
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,906
We're back on!

203
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,242
[cheering and applauding]

204
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
[Will] There was this storm.

205
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,457
[Owens] Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

206
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,085
[Will] I felt frozen.

207
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,422
[Owens] Actually frozen? Cold?

208
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,844
[Will] No, like how you feel
when you're scared,

209
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,014
and you can't breathe
or talk or do anything.

210
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,142
I felt... I felt this evil...

211
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,626
[Barbara echoing]
Nancy, this isn't you.

212
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:31,008
[Nancy] Barb, just go ahead
and go home, okay?

213
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,802
[Barbara] Nancy?

214
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,345
Nancy!

215
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,265
Nancy.

216
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,101
What's going on? Are you okay?

217
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,276
- I can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

218
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,696
- Pretending like everything's okay.
- What are you talking about?

219
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,573
Barbara.

220
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,742
It's like everyone forgot.

221
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,620
It's like nobody cares.
Except her parents.

222
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,622
- And now they're selling their house.
- Nance...

223
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,792
And they're going to spend
the rest of their lives looking for her.

224
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,335
- I know.
- It's destroying them.

225
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,422
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen,
there's nothing we can do about it.

226
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,133
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.

227
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,930
- Well, you know that we can't do that.
- We don't have to tell them everything.

228
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,725
This isn't some game, Nance.
If they found out that we told any...

229
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,235
They could put us in jail. Okay?
Or worse, they could destroy our families.

230
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,031
They could do anything they want.
Okay? Just think about what you're saying.

231
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,285
Hey...

232
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,413
Hey, hey...

233
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,917
Hey, it's... [sighs]

234
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,337
It's hard, but let's...

235
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,175
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...

236
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,762
wear our stupid costumes

237
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,723
that we've been working on
for a stupid amount of time,

238
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,978
and just pretend
like we're stupid teenagers, okay?

239
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,857
Can we just do that, just for tonight?

240
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,027
Okay.

241
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,156
Come here.

242
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,827
[Nancy sighs]

243
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,163
[ringing]

244
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,296
[Dustin clears throat] Um...

245
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,591
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is...

246
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,259
- Lucas.
- Yeah, I know.

247
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,427
The stalkers.

248
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,763
[stutters] Uh, no. Actually...

249
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,932
We weren't stalking you.

250
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,853
No, we were just concerned because,
you know, you're new and all.

251
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,313
Yeah, for your safety.

252
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,232
Mmm-hmm.
There are a lot of bullies here.

253
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,319
- [stuttering] So many bullies, it's crazy.
- Yeah.

254
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:59,781
- Is that why you're wearing proton packs?
- Well, these don't function. But...

255
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,912
I do have this
handy-dandy little trap here.

256
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,332
And look, it even opens and closes.
Look, look, look...

257
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,918
Voilà! [chuckles]

258
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,127
It's cool, right?

259
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,171
No? Okay. But, um...

260
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,507
So, we were talking last night,
and you're new here,

261
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,345
so you probably don't have any friends
to take you trick-or-treating,

262
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,473
and you're scared of bullies,
so we were thinking

263
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,767
that it would be okay if you come with us.

264
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,019
- "It'd be okay"?
- Yeah. Our party's a democracy,

265
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,437
the majority voted you could come.

266
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,190
Didn't realize it was such an honor
to go trick-or-treating with you.

267
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,192
We know where to get
the full-sized candy bars.

268
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,610
We figured you'd want in.

269
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,278
That's presumptuous of you.

270
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,451
Yeah. Totally.
Uh, so, um... you'll come?

271
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,666
We're meeting
at the Maple Street cul-de-sac at 7:00.

272
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,167
That's 7:00 on the dot!

273
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,879
"Presumptuous."

274
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,798
That's a good thing, right?

275
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,467
[sighs]

276
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
Is it bad?

277
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,891
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas?
Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?

278
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,189
[woman on TV] How does it feel?
Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.

279
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,025
[man] Inhuman. Relentless.

280
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,904
Arnold Schwarzenegger is... The Term...

281
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,615
Well, I'm stunned.
I don't know what to think.

282
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,784
- [man] Don't you love me?
- [Erica] Of course I love you.

283
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,621
It's just that it's so sudden.
I mean, it's not like you.

284
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,291
Erica, I am this way because of you.

285
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,709
- [Erica] Me?
- "Me?"

286
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,668
[man] Mmm-hmm.

287
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,212
You have made me wild and impetuous,

288
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,630
- just like you.
- "Impetuous."

289
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,173
People are going to be aghast.

290
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,051
- "People are going to be aghast."
- [man laughs] They're gonna love it.

291
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,720
[both laughing on TV]

292
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,390
I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town.
The whole world!

293
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,144
Erica, tell me that you will marry me,
in this house, tonight...

294
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,979
[television continues indistinctly]

295
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,192
[chittering]

296
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,247
[chittering]

297
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
[twig snaps]

298
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey.

299
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,496
I'm not gonna hurt you.

300
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,290
What's your name?

301
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
What're you doing out here in the cold?

302
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
[grunts]

303
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,817
[tires screeching]

304
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,489
[flies buzzing]

305
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,256
So, you're telling me that
Merrill poisoned your farm,

306
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,092
because he thinks you poisoned his,
which, of course, you didn't?

307
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,345
No, sir. And I got me an alibi
the night he accuses me.

308
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,056
My Jenny and her boys were in town.
I was with them all night.

309
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,977
- Did you actually see Merrill?
- No need. That man done lost his mind.

310
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,771
Went around slandering me,
threatening all sorts of madness.

311
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,273
- A pumpkin conspiracy.
- [chuckles]

312
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,899
Hawkins' very own Chinatown.

313
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,278
Merrill threatening to do something
and him actually doing something

314
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,571
are two very different things.

315
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,739
- You got a better explanation?
- Cold weather.

316
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
- It's October.
- Yeah, it's a cold one.
