I called you every night.
Every night for...

Why didn't you tell me you were there?

the more danger she's in.

And the more danger

So I should be thanking you?

A nice man.

163
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,766
Okay. So let me just
get this straight in my head.

164
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,060
So a nice man in a big truck,

165
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,187
he drove you to your mama's,
and then what?

166
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,065
Your Aunt Becky gave you
those clothes and that makeup?

167
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,483
I...

168
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,653
I shouldn't have left.

169
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,158
Mmm-mmm.

170
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,909
No.

171
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,746
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.

172
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,210
I should never have lied to you
about your mom.

173
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,546
Or about when you could leave.

174
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,549
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.

175
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,387
Sometimes I feel like I'm...

176
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,434
[inhales sharply]

177
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,770
Like I'm just some kind of black hole
or something. [sighs]

178
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:52,980
A black hole?

179
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,775
Yeah, it's a...
You know, it's this thing in outer space.

180
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,613
It's like, it sucks everything towards it
and destroys it.

181
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,658
Sarah had a picture book
about outer space. She loved it.

182
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,786
Who's Sarah?

183
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,370
Sarah?

184
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,251
Sarah's my girl.

185
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,923
She's my little girl.

186
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,426
Where is she?

187
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,139
Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh...

188
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,143
She left us.

189
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,898
- Gone.
- Yeah.

190
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,318
The black hole. It got her.

191
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,573
And somehow...

192
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,661
I've just been scared, you know?

193
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,122
I've just been scared
that it would take you, too.

194
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,833
I think that's why I get...

195
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,503
so mad.

196
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,007
I'm so sorry.

197
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,885
For everything.

198
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,849
I could be so... so...

199
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,184
Stupid?

200
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,479
[chuckling] Yeah. Stupid.

201
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,399
- [chuckles]
- Just really stupid.

202
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,077
I've been stupid, too.

203
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
I guess we broke our rule.

204
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,914
[chuckles softly]

205
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,001
I don't hate it, by the way.

206
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,294
This whole...

207
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,796
look.

208
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,508
It's kinda cool.

209
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,303
Bitchin'.

210
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,140
Okay. Sure.

211
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:58,772
- Bitchin'.
- [chuckles and sniffles]

212
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,581
[monster roaring in distance]

213
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,468
All right.

214
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,887
[sighs] It should fit now.

215
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,764
Is this really necessary?

216
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,934
Yes, it is, okay? This is
a ground-breaking scientific discovery.

217
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,354
We can't just bury it like
some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.

218
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,147
All right, all right, all right.

219
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,025
But you're explaining this to Mrs. Byers,
all right?

220
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,153
Christ. Help me out.

221
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get the door, man.

222
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,949
All right, I got the door.

223
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,368
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

224
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,871
[panting]

225
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,956
Phew!

226
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,551
Mike, would you just stop already?

227
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,178
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

228
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,597
That lab is swarming
with hundreds of those dogs.

229
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,808
- Demo-dogs!
- [Lucas] The chief will take care of her.

230
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,142
Like she needs protection.

231
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,019
Listen, dude,
a coach calls a play in a game,

232
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,688
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

233
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,982
Okay, first of all,
this isn't some stupid sports game.

234
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,651
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.

235
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,112
[stammers] So my point is...

236
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,826
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

237
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,120
That's not entirely true.

238
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,373
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

239
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,750
When they ran away from the bus,
they were called away.

240
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,378
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

241
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,838
Clear a path to the gate.

242
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,256
Yeah, and then we all die.

243
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,340
That's one point of view.

244
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,467
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.

245
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,885
I got it!

246
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,223
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

247
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,517
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

248
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,477
So you got all the tunnels
feeding in here.

249
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,104
Maybe if we set this on fire...

250
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,230
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

251
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,941
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

252
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

253
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,153
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

254
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,656
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

255
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,741
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

256
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,743
No buts. I promised
I'd keep you shitheads safe,

257
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,286
and that's exactly what I plan on.

258
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,246
We're staying here. On the bench.

259
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,540
And we're waiting for the starting team
to do their job.

260
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
Does everybody understand?

261
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,376
This isn't a stupid sports game.

262
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,462
I said does everybody understand that?

263
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,922
I need a yes.

264
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,717
[engine revving]

265
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,638
[rock music playing on car radio]

266
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,474
[Max] It's my brother.

267
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,977
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me. He'll kill us.

268
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,649
[tires screech]

269
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,278
[music stops playing]

270
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,162
Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington?

271
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,872
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants.

272
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,459
- [car door slams]
- What are you doing here, amigo?

273
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,003
I could ask you the same thing.

274
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,880
Amigo.

275
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,426
Looking for my stepsister.
A little birdie told me she was here.

276
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,178
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her.

277
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,056
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.

278
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,516
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.

279
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,437
[sighs] You know, I don't know, this...

280
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,649
[clicks tongue] This whole situation,
Harrington, I don't know.

281
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,651
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.

282
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:31,944
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

283
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,532
My 13-year-old sister goes missing
all day.

284
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,410
And then I find her with you
in a stranger's house.

285
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,413
And you lie to me about it.

286
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,790
[chuckles]

287
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,710
Man, were you dropped too much
as a child, or what?

288
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,339
I don't know what you don't understand
about what I just said.

289
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,509
She's not here.

290
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,970
Then who is that?

291
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,890
[exclaims] Shit! Did he see us?

292
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,642
Oh, shit. Listen...

293
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,522
- I told you to plant your feet.
- [groans]

294
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,235
Well, well, well.

295
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,239
Lucas Sinclair. What a surprise.

296
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,534
I thought I told you
to stay away from him, Max.

297
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,494
- Billy, go away.
- You disobeyed me.

298
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,372
And you know what happens
when you disobey me.

299
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,708
- Billy...
- I break things. [grunts]

300
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,378
- [indistinct yelling]
- Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!

301
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,464
Get off of me, you...

302
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,842
Since Maxine won't listen to me,
maybe you will.

303
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,719
You stay away from her.

304
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,264
Stay away from her! You hear me?

305
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,516
- I said get off me!
- [groans]

306
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,646
So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.

307
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,191
No. You are.

308
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,275
- [groans]
- [chuckles]

309
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,568
Steve!

310
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,361
[laughing]

311
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,490
Looks like you got some fire in you
after all, huh?

312
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,409
I've been waiting to meet this King Steve

313
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,704
everybody's been telling me so much about.

314
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,581
Get out.

315
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,631
- Yes! Kick his ass, Steve!
- [Mike] Get him!

316
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,507
[Dustin] Murder the son of a bitch!

317
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,551
- [Dustin] Now! Now!
- [Mike] Get that shithead!

318
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,553
- [laughs]
- [Dustin] Kill the son of a bitch!

319
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,763
- [Lucas] Steve!
- [Max] Billy!

[echoing] You little shit,
what did you do?

00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,490
What did you do?

331

From here on out, you leave me
and my friends alone. Do you understand?

334
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,964
Screw you.

335
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:47,014
Say you understand! Say it! Say it!

336
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:48,932
I understand.

It's actually kinda nice.

341
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,119
We'll do it here.

342
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,183
Are you sure this is a good idea?

343
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,061
This thing has had Will long enough.

344
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,564

All right. You let me do the heavy lifting
up front, all right?

350
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,040
You save your strength till we're below.

It's okay. You put up a good fight.

00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,009
He kicked your ass,
but you put up a fight.

- You're okay.
- [groans]

360

[Lucas] Okay, you're gonna keep straight
for a half a mile,

361
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,057
then make a left on Mount Sinai.

[Steve] What's going on?

363

Oh, my God!

Just relax. She's driven before.

- Yeah, in a parking lot.
- That counts.

Oh, my God.

368
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,611
I promised that you'd be cool, okay?

What's going on?

00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:37,244
Oh, my God. No! Whoa!
Stop the car. Slow down.

371
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,246
- I told you he'd freak out.
- Stop the car!

372
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,831
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus!

373
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,541
Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left.

I told you. Zoomer.

Oh, no. Guys.

393
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,667
Hey, where do you think you're going?

394
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,211
What are you, deaf? Hello?

395
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,173
We are not going down there right now.
I made myself clear.

396
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,009
Hey, there's no chance
we're going to that hole, all right?

397
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,303
This ends right now!

398
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,263
[Dustin] Steve, you're upset, I get it.

399
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,975
But the bottom line is,
a party member requires assistance,

400
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,936
and it is our duty
to provide that assistance.

401
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,564
Now, I know you promised Nance
that you would keep us safe.

402
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,359
So, keep us safe.

I'm pretty sure it's this way.

[Dustin] You're pretty sure,
or you're certain?

408
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,338
[Mike] I'm 100% sure.
Just follow me and you'll know.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't think so.

[Mike] What?

411
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,429
Any of you little shits die down here,
I'm getting the blame. Got it, dipshit?

412
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,682
From here on out, I'm leading the way.
Come on, let's go.

Hey, Doc.

got you pretty good, huh?

422
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,864
It's okay, don't talk.

423
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,951
Don't talk. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

This is Eleven. Eleven, Doc Owens.
Doc Owens, Eleven.

427
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,967
She's been staying with me
for about a year

428
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,428
and she's about to save our asses.

429
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,264
Maybe when this is all said and done,

430
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,892
maybe you could help her out, too,
you know?

431
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,479
Maybe you could help her lead,
like, a normal life.

432
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,982
One where she's not poked
and prodded and...

433
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,943
treated like some kind of lab rat,
you know?

434
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,779
I don't know, just a thought.

[groans]

436

But, uh... think about it.

00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,374
Don't go anywhere.

Look... look at him!
