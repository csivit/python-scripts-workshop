1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,480
[Claudia] Dusty!

2
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,191
Dusty, how was it?

3
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,609
[stammers] How was what?

4
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,071
"How was what?"
The greatest night of the year, of course.

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,742
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was...
It was, uh, tubular.

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,535
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

7
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,704
- Did something happen?
- No. What? No.

8
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,205
Are you constipated again?

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,498
No. Mom!

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,791
Okay, you're acting weird.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,376
- I am not acting weird!
- [thudding]

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,461
- Whoa!
- Ah!

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,212
- [laughing nervously]
- [hissing]

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,675
Awesome, right? Yeah...
I rigged the trap with, uh,

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,344
a motor to make it look like
I caught a ghost.

16
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,596
Just like the movie.

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,182
- [laughs nervously] Oh, Dusty.
- [laughs] Yeah.

18
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,476
[both laughing]

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,689
Funny. Look at that. Look at that.

20
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,281
I told you to keep quiet.

21
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,534
All you had to do was stay still
for one minute.

22
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,911
One minute.

23
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,581
Sorry, Yertle.

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,333
Temporary eviction, buddy.

25
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,630
[chittering]

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,012
What are you, little guy?

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,268
What were you doing in my trash?

28
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,729
You hungry?

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,745
Nougat.

30
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,289
- Go on, eat.
- [screeches]

31
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,543
Too hot?

32
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,338
Sorry about that, little guy.

33
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,925
[chuckles]

34
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,052
You like nougat, too, huh?

35
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,807
You're pretty cute, you know that?

36
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,059
I'm glad I found you. [chuckles]

37
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,231
D'Artagnan.

38
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,775
I'm gonna call you d'Artagnan.

39
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,085
[d'Artagnan chittering]

40
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,446
[screeches]

41
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,948
[theme music playing]

42
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,465
[footsteps approaching]

43
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,691
[Hopper] Rise and shine.

44
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,074
So that's it, huh?
You're still not talking?

45
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,829
All right.

46
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,916
I guess I'm just gonna have to, uh...

47
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,336
enjoy this triple-decker
Eggo extravaganza on my own.

48
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,639
[Hopper grunts]

49
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,434
Mmm!

50
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,478
Mmm!

51
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,562
Good, right?

52
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,565
Know the great thing about it?
It's only 8,000 calories.

53
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,238
[sniffles]

54
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,868
You visited him again last night?

55
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,707
He says he needs me.

56
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,293
Want me to go check on him?

57
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,380
I know that you miss him, all right?

58
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,132
But it's too dangerous.

59
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,220
You're the last thing he needs right now.

60
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,889
You're gonna see him. Soon.

61
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:34,143
And not just in that head of yours.
You're gonna see him in real life.

62
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,814
I feel like I'm making progress
with these people.

63
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,608
Friends don't lie.

64
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,651
What?

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,070
You say "soon" on day 21.

66
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,448
You say "soon" on day 205.

67
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,661
- You now say "soon" on day 326?
- What is this?

68
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,205
You're counting the days now
like you're some kind of prisoner?

69
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,290
When is "soon"?

70
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,084
"Soon" is when...

71
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,670
it's not dangerous anymore.

72
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,088
When?

73
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,926
- I don't know.
- On day 500?

74
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,344
- I don't know.
- On day 600?

75
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,179
- I don't know.
- Day 700?

76
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,639
- On day 800?
- No!

77
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,266
- I need to see him. Tell me!
- I said I...

78
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,103
Oh! Shit! Shit!

79
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,606
Friends don't lie!

80
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,824
Jesus. Have you seen them?

81
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,369
- We're looking, Mom.
- Yeah, we're... we're looking.

82
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,080
- [Bob] A-ha! Found 'em. [chuckles]
- [Joyce] Oh!

83
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,999
Hiding under some jeans,
sneaky little buggers.

84
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,751
Thank you. Thank you.
You're a life saver.

85
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,379
Can you take Will to school today?
I cannot be late again.

86
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,632
- He's staying over now?
- Can you just take Will, please?

87
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,009
I can take him.

88
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,554
- Will you make sure he gets in okay?
- Yeah, of course.

89
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,098
What do you say, big guy?
Wanna go for a ride in the Bobmobile?

90
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,294
Mr. Henderson, you know the rules.
Five at a time.

91
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,295
Yep.

92
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,632
One, two, three, four and five.

93
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,717
Ten.

94
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,928
You already have five books checked out.

95
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,221
My mistake.

96
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,972
However...

97
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,727
I am on a curiosity voyage,
and I need my paddles to travel.

98
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,479
These books...

99
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,190
These books are my paddles.

100
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,069
Five at a time.

101
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,321
- Are you shitting me?
- Excuse me?

102
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,198
What the hell is...

103
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,035
- Mr. Henderson!
- I need my paddles!

104
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,256
Was that you I heard milling around
last night, or was that a ghost?

105
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,508
Yeah. Me, probably.

106
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,721
- Another nightmare?
- Um... no.

107
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,351
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?

108
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,105
- Mr. Baldo?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,524
I was a little younger than you,

110
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,193
standing in line for the Ferris wheel
at the Roane County fair.

111
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,028
- Mmm-hmm.
- And suddenly,

112
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,823
I feel this fat white glove
tap me on the shoulder.

113
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,158
I spin around, and there he is.

114
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,743
Mr. Baldo.

115
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,372
[imitating clown]
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"

116
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,458
[chuckles] Go ahead, laugh. It's funny.

117
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
It wasn't funny back then,
I can tell you that.

118
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,381
I couldn't get him out of my head.

119
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,467
Every night, he would come
to me in my dreams.

120
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,177
And every night when he came to me...

121
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,679
I ran.

122
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,059
[sighs] It got so bad that I made
my mom stay in the room with me

123
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,145
until I could fall asleep every night.

124
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,397
- Really?
- Really.

125
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,899
It went on like that for months.

126
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,320
And then one day,
the nightmares suddenly stopped.

127
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,032
- Wanna know how?
- How?

128
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,160
Well, I fell asleep...

129
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,372
and just like always,
Mr. Baldo came to me.

130
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,667
Only this time, I didn't run.

131
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,670
This time, I stood my ground.

132
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,506
I just looked at Mr. Baldo

133
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,926
in his stupid face, and I said,
"Go away. Go away!"

134
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,557
Just like that, he was gone.

135
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,517
Never saw him again.

136
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,479
Easy-peasy, right?

137
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,649
Easy-peasy.

138
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,941
Just like that.

139
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,154
I still don't get why
they call him zombie boy.

140
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,823
I mean, I get it. He got lost in the woods
for a week or something,

141
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,285
but why is he a zombie?
Because everyone thought he was dead?

142
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,914
Yeah. I mean, we had a funeral
for him and everything.

143
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,582
After a week?

144
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,960
Well, see,
some other kid drowned at the quarry.

145
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,713
We thought it was Will
because his body was super decomposed.

146
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,756
What?

147
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,424
Okay, that's not funny.

148
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,593
It's not a joke, all right?
It's public knowledge.

149
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,095
You can ask anybody.

150
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,889
Except Will,
because he is really sensitive about it.

151
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:22,973
All right?

152
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,725
Okay.

153
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
[Bob] Have a great day, kiddo.

154
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,283
[Mr. Clarke] The case of Phineas Gage

155
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,953
is one of the great medical curiosities
of all time.

156
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:49,166
Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848
who had a nightmarish accident.

157
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,878
A large iron rod was driven
completely through his head.

158
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,967
Phineas miraculously survived.
He seemed fine.

159
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,386
And physically, yes, he was.

160
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,348
But his injury resulted
in a complete change to his personality.

161
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,476
So much so that friends that knew him

162

always keep the curtains drawn.

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,910
Well, Dart, he isn't.
He doesn't need water.

319
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,121
Yeah, but aren't there
nonaquatic pollywogs?

320
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,374
Terrestrial pollywogs?
Yep. Two to be exact.

321
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,917
Indirana semipalmata.

322
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,670
And the Adenomera andreae.

323
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,173
One's from India,
one's from South America.

324
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,966
So how did one end up in my trash?

325
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,510
Maybe some scientists brought it here,
and it escaped?

326
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,928
Do you guys see that?

327
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,347
Looks like something
is moving inside of it.

328
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,478
- [screeches]
- [both gasp]

329
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,689
[Dustin] Whoa.

330
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,899
It's okay. It's okay.

331
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,151
- I got you, little guy.
- [chittering]

332
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,904
I know you don't like that. It's okay.

333
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,197
And there's another thing.

334
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,908
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.
Ectothermic, right?

335
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,244
They love heat, the sun.
Dart hates it. It hurts him.

336
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,039
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile...

337
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,083
Then I've discovered a new species.

338
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,264
[bell rings]

339
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,102
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.

340
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,896
- What if he steals my discovery?
- He's not gonna steal your discovery.

341
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,899
You know, I'm thinking about calling it
Dustonious pollywogus.

342
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,151
- What do you think?
- I think you're an idiot.

343
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,070
When I become
rich and famous for this one day,

344
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,446
don't come crawling back, saying,

345
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,408
"Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry
for being mean to you back in 8th grade.

346
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,409
Oh, my God."

347
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,501
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

348
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,379
Baloney?

349
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,798
Mmm.

350
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,802
- Last night was fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

351
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,347
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.

352
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,599
No! No, you didn't.

353
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,893
Okay.

354
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,895
I mean...

355
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,690
I... I like you so much.

356
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,610
Not just you,
everything that comes with you.

357
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,487
Your family, your boys.

358
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,948
And I hope it's not
wishful thinking, but...

359
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,659
I kinda feel like
I'm breaking through with them.

360
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,078
Not so much Jonathan.
He's a tough cookie to crack, but...

361
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,079
Yeah.

362
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,041
With Will, I don't know,
I feel like we're connecting.

363
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,459
He likes you, too.

364
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,794
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

365
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,171
I can tell.

366
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,255
Good.

367
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,844
Oh, there was...
something else I was gonna mention, but...

368
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,180
It's not a big deal at all, but...

369
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,559
I just noticed this morning that my JVC
was a little dinged up.

370
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,854
- Your what?
- The video camera.

371
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,939
- Oh.
- Yeah.

372
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,150
It still works fine and everything.
I just...

373
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,027
I went back and watched the tape...

374
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:51,031
and there were some older kids
picking on Will.

375
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,325
- What?
- They scared him.

376
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,036
Who were they?
Were they the Zimmerman brothers again?

377
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,329
Um, I don't know.

378
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,289
They were wearing masks
or sort of makeup and...

379
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,832
Maybe. They were the right age.

380
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,334
I'll kill them.

381
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,503
I swear to God, I will...
I will kill them.

382
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,089
That's what I love about you.
You punch back.

383
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,385
[chuckles] I was never really one
to put up a fight.

384
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,598
I struggled a lot like Will
when I was a kid.

385
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,225
With bullies.

386
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,478
[sighs] It's the ones like us,
that don't punch back,

387
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,521
that people really take
advantage of, you know?

388
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,024
They rub your nose in it,
just a little bit more.

389
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,277
I don't know why they do that.

390
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,366
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.

391
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,577
I don't know.

392
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,330
But, hey, look at me now.

393
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,333
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!

394
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,044
- [chuckles]
- Are you kidding me? I get to date...

395
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,588
It all works out in the end,
doesn't it?

396
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,006
Yes, it does.

397
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,017
[Hopper] Grass, crops, trees.

398
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,478
Everything in this area
is either dead or dying,

399
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,772
and that's a radius of over three miles.

400
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,565
And it all leads back to here.

401
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,487
See, these patterns here
are really pretty. I like the design.

402
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,489
It's almost psychedelic.

403
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,243
- This is a joke to you, huh?
- No, it's not a joke. I just...

404
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,829
I don't understand what this
has to do with me, Chief Hopper.

405
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:25,125
Whatever is happening is spreading
from this place, from this lab.

406
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:29,129
That's impossible. It's...
The last burn was two days ago.

407
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,505
It's contained.

408
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:33,550
- What if there's a leak?
- A leak? [scoffs]

409
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,344
- I don't know, man. You're the scientist.
- Exactly.

410
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,888
And I'm telling you
there's nothing to worry about.

411
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,640
- Convince me.
- Convince you?

412
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,060
Yeah. You and your egghead friends

413
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,605
go out there to every area on this map
and you run your tests,

414
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,526
or whatever the hell it is you do,
and you see if anything comes up.

415
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,737
[scoffs] All right, so...

416
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,281
So you're... you're giving me orders now?

417
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,033
No.

418
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,952
- I keep things nice and quiet for you...
- Mmm-hmm.

419
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,414
And you keep your shit out of my town.

420
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,790
That is the deal.

421
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,960
I have done my part, now you do yours.

422
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,758
Convince me.

423
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,387
So, he asked you to take me home?

424
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:20,972
Yeah.

425
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,058
Yeah, he was upset.

426
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,685
I mean, he was... He was really upset.

427
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,357
But he was still worried about you.

428
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,860
Hey.

429
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,321
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay?

430
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,449
People say stupid things
when they're wasted.

431
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,784
Things they don't mean.

432
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,369
Yeah, but that's the thing.

433
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,454
What if I did mean it?

434
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,917
All this time, I've been trying
so hard to pretend like everything's fine,

435
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,002
but it's not.

436
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,797
I... I feel like there's this...

437
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,549
I don't know, like this...

438
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,427
Like there's this weight
you're carrying around with you.

439
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,721
All the time.

440
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,972
I feel it, too.

441
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,475
Yeah, but it's different for you.

442
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,310
Will came home.

443
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,269
Yeah.

444
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,938
Yeah, he did.

445
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,607
But he's not the same.

446
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:17,153
I try to be there for him,
you know, to help him, but...

447
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,948
[sighs] I don't know.

448
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,326
I mean, maybe...

449
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,580
maybe things just can't go back
to the way they were.

450
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,167
Doesn't that make you mad?

451
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:32,961
Mad?

452
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,005
Yeah, that those...
those people who did this,

453
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,008
who ruined so many lives,
they just get away with it.

454
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,010
The people responsible for this...

455
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,596
- they're dead.
- Do you really believe that?

456
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,563
[rock song playing over headphones]

457
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,484
Your mom's boyfriend.

458
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,738
- He works at RadioShack, right?
- Yeah.

459
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,865
Why?

460
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,285
What are you thinking?

461
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,289
Do you wanna skip fourth period?

462
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,500
[woman laughing] Isn't this fun?

463
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,252
[continues laughing]

464
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,687
[continues laughing] Pump your feet.

465
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,694
[Hopper] "I would feel so sad if I thought
I was a disappointment to her..."

466
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,405
because she didn't live
very long after that, you see.

467
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,867
She died of a fever
when I was just three months old.

468
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,663
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me
to remember calling her mother.

469
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,582
"I think it would be so sweet
to say 'mother.'"

470
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,334
Do I have a mother?

471
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
Yeah, of course you have a mother.

472
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,756
You couldn't really be born without one.

473
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,092
Where is she?

474
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,344
She...

475
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,973
She's not around anymore.

476
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,518
Gone?

477
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:13,978
Yeah.

478
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,277
I'm sorry about that, kid.

479
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,081
"And, uh, father died
four days afterwards from fever, too."

480
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,542
That left me an orphan
and folks were at their wits' end,

481
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,586
so Mrs. Thomas said to me,
what to do with me.

482
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,214
You see, nobody wanted me even then.

483
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,049
"It seems to be my fate."

484
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,051
[woman] Is your mom here?

485
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,970
Sweetie?

486
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,682
School.

487
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,310
Where is school?

488
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,730
The school? It's, uh...
it's about a mile that way.

489
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,315
At least.

490
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,568
Where are your parents?

491
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,196
[metal squeaking]

492
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,115
[girl] Look, Mommy, look.

493
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,278
[phone ringing]

494
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,532
RadioShack, Bob Newby speaking.
How can I help ya?

495
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,242
Bob, it's Joyce.

496
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,827
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?

497
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,830
Hey, um... I'm trying
to watch your video thingy,

498
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,375
and the tape, it's... it's tiny.
It's like it's shrunk.

499
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,253
[chuckles] That's 'cause it's a VHS-C,
not a VHS.

500
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,881
You gotta find the RF-P1U
with coaxial cable

501
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,008
so you can connect the video ins and outs.

502
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,843
Bob, English.

503
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
Right. Sorry. Um...

504
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,184
No, yeah, I did the coaxial things
in the back, so I...

505
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,728
This one just goes into the camera itself?

506
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,940
- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
- It's blue. I think it's working.

507
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,191
I was thinking maybe tonight...

508
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,734
- [dial tone]
- Joyce?

509
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:32,158
So you hit T to zoom in,
and W zooms back out.

510
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,534
See? Easy-peasy.

511
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,396
[boy 1] Watch it, zombie boy.

512
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,147
[boy 2] Trick or treat, freak.

513
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,149
Boo!

514
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,111
- [boys laughing]
- Loser.

515
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,989
[Will] Mike! Mike!

516
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,292
[ringing]

517
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,380
Will, you coming?
Let's go show Mr. Clarke.

518
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,758
What?

519
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,760
What?

520
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,803
It's about d'Artagnan.

521
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,473
This is the reason I was late for class.

522
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,059
Pretty neat. These doors function?

523
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,519
Well, yeah, obviously.
But it's not about the trap.

524
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,812
It's what's inside.

525
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,940
Now, this very well may change
your perception of the world.

526
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,108
Consider my interest piqued.

527
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,320
All right, first,
let's just clarify that...

528
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,655
this is my discovery, not yours.

529
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,074
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!

530
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,742
- I'm just trying to clarify...
- Dustin!

531
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,993
- Okay, fine.
- [door opens]

532
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,078
[Mike] Stop!

533
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,205
I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke.
It was just a stupid prank.

534
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,457
- What are you doing?
- I told him to stop. We need to go.

535
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,375
- [Dustin] Mike!
- Right now. Right now!

536
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,799
So, your sister coming or what?

537
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,344
Screw it. That little shit can skate home.

538
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,931
- And don't call her that.
- What?

539
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,183
Sister. She's not my sister.

540
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,023
[rock music playing loudly]

541
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,445
[banging on door]

542
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,447
Hello? Hello?

543
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,783
- Guys, come on. Can I come in yet?
- [Mike] No!

544
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,161
- I don't understand.
- What do you not understand?

545
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,081
Will saw something
that looked like Dart last year?

546
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,125
Kind of, but there was no tail.

547
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,293
But then he heard it yesterday.
The exact same sound.

548
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,420
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- I wasn't sure.

549
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,797
- A coincidence.
- [Mike] Or not.

550
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,757
What if when Will was stuck
in the Upside Down,

551
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,425
he somehow acquired True Sight?

552
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,426
True Sight?

553
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,679
It gives you the power
to see into the ethereal plane.

554
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,389
[sighs] Elaborate.

555
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,934
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps
having aren't really flashbacks at all.

556
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,269
Maybe they're real.

557
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,688
Maybe Will can somehow see
into the Upside Down.

558
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,274
- So that would mean...
- Dart is from the Upside Down.

559
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,776
- [sighs] We have to take him to Hopper.
- I agree.

560
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,028
No way. If we take him to Hopper,
Dart's good as dead.

561
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,947
- Maybe he should be.
- How can you say that?

562
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,699
How can you not?
He's from the Upside Down.

563
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,618
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't
automatically mean that he's bad.

564
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,079
That's like saying just because
someone's from the Death Star

565
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,789
- doesn't make them bad.
- We have a bond.

566
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,333
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?

567
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,585
No, because he trusts me!

568
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,961
He trusts you?

569
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,713
Yes, I promised
I would take care of him.

570
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,423
[Dart screeching]

571
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,219
Guys, what's going on? Come on.

572
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,649
- Don't hurt him.
- Only if he attacks.

573
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,151
Just open it already.

574
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,075
Holy shit!

575
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,792
Oh, shit!

576
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,336
No!

577
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,426
[Max] What the...

578
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,345
Oh, shit!

579
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,139
[Lucas] Where'd he go?

580
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,307
- What was that?
- Dart!

581
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,850
- What?
- You let him escape!

582
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,894
- Why did you attack him?
- Come on.

583
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,146
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!

584
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,446
Jonathan?

585
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,531
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler.

586
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,659
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah.

587
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,912
- Uh, we have a test tomorrow.
- Hmm.

588
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:32,375
- Oh, did you go shopping?
- Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke.

589
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,876
- Aw!
- [Jonathan] Bummer.

590
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,711
Anyway, we should go.
It's a really big test.

591
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,129
- Yeah.
- So...

592
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,673
- Stressful.
- Very.

593
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,009
- Bye, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Bye! It's good to see you.

594
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,388
[sighs] Okay, are you sure about this?

595
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:46,347
No.

596
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,899
[phone ringing]

597
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,527
Hello. Marsha speaking.

598
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,320
Hello?

599
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,114
Hello?

600
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:07,326
Mrs. Holland. Hi, it's, um... it's Nancy.

601
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,953
Nancy?

602
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:09,954
I, uh...

603
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,750
I need to tell you something.
Something about Barb.

604
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,919
About that night. I, uh...

605
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,797
I, uh... I haven't been honest with you.

606
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,593
But I can't tell you here on the phone.

607
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,847
Meet me tomorrow,
Forrest Hills Park, 9:00 a. m.

608
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,056
Don't tell anyone.

609
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,517
And don't call me back here.
It's dangerous.

610
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,935
[Marsha] Nancy, what is this?

611
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,354
[Nancy] I just need you
to trust me. Please.

612
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,079
[Owens] Well, you were right
about these pumpkins.

613
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,873
Some nasty stuff.

614
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,083
[chuckling] And the smell...
Gee, mother of God.

615
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,710
What exactly do you think
is going on...

616
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,962
Well, I told you what I think.

617
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,715
But we'll run the tests,
and we'll see what comes up.

618
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,385
In the meantime, I just need you
to keep the area clear for us.

619
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,429
I don't think it'll be
more than a day or two.

620
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,264
What do you want me to tell people?

621
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,351
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

622
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,355
- [Powell on radio] Hey, Chief, you copy?
- Yeah.

623
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,067
Do you remember that Russian girl
Murray was going on about the other day?

624
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,612
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking
he's not so crazy after all.

625
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,283
Stay where you are. Do not move.

626
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,458
East is clear. No sign of Dart.

627
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,547
Where'd you go, you little bastard?

628
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,154
West is clear, too. Will?

629
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,531
South is clear. Lucas?

630
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:51,949
Anything?

631
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,953
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!

632
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,664
[stammering] Sorry,
I was looking for study hall.

633
00:40:58,747 --> 00:40:59,623
Bye.

634
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,208
Nothing here, man.

635
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,211
[objects clattering]

636
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,216
[yells]

637
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,843
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

638
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,470
- Why are you in here?
- Looking for Dart.

639
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:55,971
- This is the boys' room.
- Yeah, so?

640
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,598
So you should go home.

641
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,811
- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.

642
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,856
- How can I hate you? I don't know you.
- But you don't want me in your party.

643
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,899
- Correct.
- Why not?

644
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,069
Because you're annoying.
Also, we don't need another party member.

645
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:14,114
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric,
Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,

646
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,616
and El is our mage.

647
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,869
- El? Who's El?
- Someone. No one.

648
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,120
Someone or no one?

649
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,457
She was in our party a long time ago.
She moved away, okay?

650
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,918
She was a mage?

651
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,547
Well, what could she do?
Like, magic tricks or something?

652
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,423
Well, I could be your zoomer.

653
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,842
- That's not even a real thing.
- It could be.

654
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,097
- See? Zoomer.
- Mind-blowing.

655
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,974
Come on, you know you're impressed.

656
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,604
[Mike] I don't see any tricks.
You're just going around in a circle.

657
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,690
[Max] If it's so easy, you try it.

658
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,316
- [Mike] No.
- [Max] Why not?

659
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,442
[Mike] I don't know how.

660
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,653
[Max] So, then you admit
it's kind of impressive.

661
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,864
[Mike] I think if I spent, like,
all day practicing, I could do that.

662
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,576
[Max] I would give you a million bucks
if you could.

663
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,703
[Mike] Okay, you're making me dizzy.

664
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:03,247
- Please just stop.
- I'll stop when I join your party.

665
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,959
- Come on, just stop.
- It's a simple question. Am I in or out?

666
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,136
[grunts]

667
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,682
Jesus! Are you all right?

668
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,809
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

669
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,312
- What happened?
- I don't know.

670
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,189
It was like a magnet or something
pulling on my board.

671
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,566
I know that sounds crazy.

672
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,586
- [line ringing]
- [sighs] Come on, come on, come on!

673
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,674
[phone ringing]

674
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,762
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?

675
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,513
Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.

676
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,223
- Uh, Joyce Byers.
- [mouthing] Joyce.

677
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,935
Uh, Will has AV Club today.
Could you transfer me to Mr. Clarke?

678
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,563
- Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what?
- What?

679
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,733
I just saw him leave for the day.
Maybe AV was canceled?

680
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,652
- What?
- Would you like me to...

681
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,338
[Dart chittering]

682
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,111
Guys...

683
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,280
- I found him.
- [Dustin] Where?

684
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,743
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

685
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,869
[Mike] Copy that.

686
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,415
It's okay.

687
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,750
I'm not gonna hurt you.

688
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,628
[screeches]

689
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,067
[monster growling]

690
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,052
Hey, buddy.

691
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,724
- Come here. You know I won't hurt you.
- [chittering]

692
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,935
It's okay. It's just me.

693
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,062
You're okay.

694
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,315
- [Mike] Let's go. Down here.
- [Lucas] We're coming!

695
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,820
Stay low. Keep quiet.

696
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,324
Where's Dart?

697
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,201
- I don't know. Not here.
- What?

698
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,704
- [Max] He said by Salerno's, right?
- [Dustin] Yeah, maybe Will has him.

699
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,499
Where is Will?

700
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,717
Only this time, I didn't run.

701
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,726
This time, I stood my ground.

702
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,438
[breathing heavily]

703
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:01,777
[screeching]

704
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,408
I said, "Go away. Go away!"

705
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,286
Go away!

706
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,501
Go away!

707
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,587
Go away!

708
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,633
Go away! Go away!

709
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,845
- Go away!
- [screeching]

710
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,272
Easy-peasy, right?

711
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,942
Easy-peasy.

712
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,862
Just like that.
