Well, when you were having
sister problems, Dart grew again,

161
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,396
he escaped, and I'm pretty sure
he's a baby Demogorgon.

162
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,690
- Wait. What?
- I'll explain later.

163
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,026
- Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard.
- Steve?

164
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,944
And bring your binoculars
and wrist rocket.

165
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,237
[Lucas] Steve Harrington?

166
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,573
All right, let's go.

167
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,534
Just be there, stat. Over and out.

168
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,458
[retches]

169
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,793
All right, cowboy, good news.

170
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,962
We're giving you the green light.

171
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,631
How you feeling?

172
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,092
Never better.

173
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,637
All right, well, got a present for ya.

174
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,767
- The hell is that? [sniffles]
- Uh, something you should see.

175
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,395
[grunts and sighs]

176
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,530
[Owens] Watch your step.

177
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:19,692
All living organisms develop
defense mechanisms against attack.

178
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,487
They adapt. They find some way to survive.

179
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,660
[indistinct chatter]

180
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,876
[Hopper] Oh, my God.

181
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,879
[Owens] It's pretty impressive, isn't it?

182
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,881
It's been spreading,

183
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,509
growing beneath us like some cancer.

184
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,305
- [Hopper] Why aren't you burning it?
- [Owens] There's a complication.

185
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,436
[monitor beeping]

186
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,105
[Joyce] They made me sign,
like, a thousand documents.

187
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,860
I mean... [stammering]
we all had to. We had to.

188
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,738
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.

189
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,324
They're gonna make you
do the same. I'm sure.

190
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,784
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.

191
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
What kind of documents?

192
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,666
Uh, confidentiality,

193
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,211
and there were these official forms
saying, like, nothing ever happened,

194
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,296
which is why...

195
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,215
Will got lost in the woods.

196
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,175
[Joyce] Yeah.

197
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:33,140
Man, I always thought stuff like this
happened in movies and comic books.

198
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,019
Certainly not in Hawkins,
and certainly not to someone like you.

199
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,313
- Or you.
- Yeah.

200
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,275
Bob Newby, superhero. [chuckles softly]

201
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,819
[Bob sighs]

202
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,114
You cold?

203
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,450
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.

204
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,911
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.

205
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,746
- Okay.
- Okay? I'm fine.

206
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,956
I'm fine.

207
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,836
It's not like you didn't warn me.
"This is not a normal family."

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,047
- Isn't that what you said?
- Yeah.

209
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,217
- [chuckles] You weren't kidding.
- [sighs]

210
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,805
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine
sound a little less crazy, right?

211
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,599
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.

212
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,687
[Will] Mom?

213
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,398
[gasps] Hey.

214
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,567
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!

215
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,571
- Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay?
- Okay, they're on their way.

216
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,531
Hey.

217
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,994
- Who is that?
- What?

218
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,038
- What?
- [chuckles] It's me, big guy. It's Bob.

219
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,333
Are you a...

220
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,545
doctor?

221
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:48,966
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.

222
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,105
[exhales heavily]

223
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,736
[sighs]

224
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,116
[sniffles]

225
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,423
So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?

226
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,883
[spits]

227
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,092
Uh, sorry?

228
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,762
The sofa.

229
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,682
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.

230
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,350
I bet.

231
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,230
Oops. [chuckles]

232
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,233
Mmm.

233
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,696
Oh, yeah.

234
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,782
Yeah, we just, um...

235
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,743
We just had some fun girl time.

236
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,661
- [Karen] Will you be back for dinner?
- Mmm-hmm.

237
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,914
- Yeah, I'll be home real soon.
- Say hey to Ally for me.

238
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,500
Okay. All right.
I love you, too, Mom. Bye.

239
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,630
She said Mike's at your brother's house.
They just had a sleepover. So...

240
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,298
Oh, okay.

241
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,133
Do you wanna try again?

242
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,179
No. No, it's fine. They're probably
just at the matinée or something.

243
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,640
Yeah, I'm sure.

244
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,566
For your travels.

245
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,112
And to water it down.

246
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,239
Got it.

247
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,034
Thank you for everything.

248
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,247
Don't thank me yet.
Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm?

249
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,541
And if you need to reach me again...

250
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,168
don't.

251
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,045
- [door slams]

252

[rock song playing in the distance]

00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,600
[sighs]

[rock song continues playing on TV]

255
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,065
- [doorbell ringing]
- Twenty-one.

256
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,112
Twenty-two.

257
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,281
[doorbell continues ringing]

258
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,242
- Max, are you getting that or what?
- Okay!

259
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,161
[Billy] Swear to God, Max!

260
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,705
[doorbell continues ringing]

261
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,833
[exhales heavily]

262
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,381
What are you doing here?

263
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,716
- I have proof.
- What?

264
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,594
Proof that what I told you was real.
But we have to hurry.

265
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,470
What kind of proof?

266
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,806
[rock song continues playing]

267
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,916
Who the hell were you talking to?

268
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,588
Mormons.

269
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,089
Mormons?

270
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,175
Talkative ones.

271
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,195
Come on, hop on.

272
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,031
Hurry.

273
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,743
This better be good, stalker.

274
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,460
[monitor beeping regularly]

275
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,422
Do you know your name?

276
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,757
Will.

277
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,635
- Your full name?
- William Byers.

278
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,929
Do you know... Do you know who I am?

279
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,140
A doctor.

280
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,185
Have we met before?

281
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,272
- I don't remember.
- [Owens] Hmm.

282
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,149
You don't remember me?

283
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,152
Okay.

284
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,029
How about, uh... How about this guy here?

285
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,118
Know who that is?

286
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,207
It's all right. Take your time.

287
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,044
That's my friend.

288
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,547
Mike.

289
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,676
What about me, kid? You remember me?

290
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:52,436
They tell me you helped save me
last night. You remember that?

291
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:57,816
Do you remember anything about last night?
About what happened?

292
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,445
I remember they hurt me.

293
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,654
[Will groans]

294
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,741
You mean the doctors?

295
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,995
No. The soldiers.

296
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,289
The soldiers hurt you?

297
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,042
They shouldn't have done that.

298
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,502
It upset him.

299
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,718
[Owens] You say, "Upset him." Is that him?

300
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,770
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.

301
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,980
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,

302
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,858
but I think it's really gonna help us
understand what's going on.

303
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,984
Is that okay?

304
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,236
Okay.

305
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:53,080
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know
if you feel anything. Okay?

306
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,214
[soft screeching]

[beeping regularly]

308
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,472
- Do you feel anything?
- [stammers] Little sting.

309
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,100
- [Owens] It stings? Where?
- [screeches]

310
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,351
[grunts] My chest.

311
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,562
- Okay, son.
- Sweetie...

[Will groans]

313
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,109
- How about now?
- It... it burns.

314
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,610
- [screeches]
- Ah!

315
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,070
- It burns.
- [Owens] Where?

316
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,447
[groans] Everywhere.

317
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,075
That's enough. That's enough!

318
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,078
- [screaming]
- Stop! You heard her! That's enough!

319
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,496
That's it! We're done!

320
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,331
- Okay.
- [monitor beeping rapidly]

321
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,126
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.

322
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,211
[beeping regularly]

323
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:45,841
Our best guess right now
is it's some kind of virus

324
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,220
which is causing
this neurological disorder.

325
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,432
Now, when... when a typical virus
attaches itself to its host...

326
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,851
[coughs]

327
00:23:55,934 --> 00:24:01,481
İt duplicates, right? It spreads,
essentially hijacking the host.

328
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,067
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.

329
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,527
[growling]

330
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,195
That's not... That's not unusual.

331
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,615
What is so unusual here,

332
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,371
this virus... the infected hosts
seem to be communicating.

333
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,998
[screaming]

334
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:24,963
It has some sort of a hive intelligence,
and it's connecting all the hosts.

335
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,173
- [screeches]
- [screaming]

336
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,633
The good news is a virus can be cured.

337
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,469
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.

338
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,638
We're gonna see what we find.

339
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:39,060
What happens
when he can't remember anything?

340
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,438
[stutters] When there's
nothing else there?

341
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,150
What happens when my boy is gone?

342
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,111
[crying]

343
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,828
[Steve] All right,
so let me get this straight.

344
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,247
You kept something
you knew was probably dangerous

345
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:04,252
in order to impress a girl who...
who you just met?

346
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,756
All right,
that's grossly oversimplifying things.

347
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,425
I mean, why would a girl
like some nasty slug anyway?

348
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,053
An interdimensional slug?
Because it's awesome.

349
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,931
Well, even if she thought it was cool,
which she didn't, I... I just...

350
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,309
I don't know. I just feel like
you're trying too hard.

351
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,937
Well, not everyone can have
your perfect hair, all right?

352
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,688
It's not about the hair, man.

353
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,816
The key with girls is just...
just acting like you don't care.

354
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,528
- Even if you do?
- Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.

355
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,198
- Then what?
- You just wait until, uh...

356
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,328
- until you feel it.
- Feel what?

357
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,914
It's like before it's gonna storm,
you know?

358
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,708
You can't see it,
but you can feel it, like this, uh...

359
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,587
electricity, you know?

360
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,632
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field
when the clouds in the atmosphere...

361
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,219
No, no, no, no, no.
Like a... Like a sexual electricity.

362
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,178
Oh.

363
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,766
You feel that and then you make your move.

364
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,309
So that's when you kiss her?

365
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,062
- No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo.
- Sorry.

366
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:08,233
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah,
they want you to be aggressive.

367
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,027
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...

368
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,738
- I don't know, like a lion.
- Mmm.

369
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,575
But others, you gotta be slow,
you gotta be stealthy, like a...

370
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,244
like a ninja.

371
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,787
What type is Nancy?

372
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,833
Nancy's different.
She's different than the other girls.

373
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,502
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.

374
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,212
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

375
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:34,050
But this girl's special, too, you know.
It's just, like, something about her.

376
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,428
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

377
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,513
You're not falling in love with this girl,
are you?

378
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,974
Uh, no. No.

379
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,894
- Okay, good. Don't.
- I won't.

380
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,356
She's only gonna break your heart,
and you're way too young for that shit.

381
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,449
Fabergé.

382
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,533
What?

383
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
It's Fabergé Organics.

384
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,582
Use the shampoo and conditioner,
and when your hair's damp...

385
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:06,791
It's not wet, okay?

386
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,460
- When it's damp...
- Damp.

387
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:11,796
You do four puffs
of the Farrah Fawcett spray.

388
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,800
- Farrah Fawcett spray?
- Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.

389
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,971
You tell anyone I just told you that
and your ass is grass.

390
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,015
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?

391
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:22,974
Yup.

392
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,559
[sighs]

393
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,311
Okay.

394
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,816
- Farrah Fawcett, really?
- I mean, she's hot.

395
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,526
[Dustin] Yeah.

396
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,071
[flies buzzing]

397
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,033
[static crackling]

398
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,332
[sighing]

399
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,796
Hey, it's, uh...

400
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,256
[sighs]

401
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
It's me.

402
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,554
I know that I've been
gone too long, and, uh...

403
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,767
It's... I just, I want you to know
that it's not about you

404
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,727
and it's not about our fight.

405
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,021
Okay?

406
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:16,236
Something came up, and I will...
I will explain it all when I see you.

407
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,780
I just... I want you to know
that I'm not mad.

408
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,283
I'm just sorry.

409
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,414
About everything.

410
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,794
I...

411
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,756
I don't want you to get hurt at all.

412
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,344
And I don't wanna lose you.

413
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,391
[sighs]

414
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:52,147
[sniffles] Just make sure you heat up
some real food. Not just Eggos.

415
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,192
And I want you to eat all the peas,
even if they're mushy and gross. And...

416
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,194
[sighs]

417
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,822
I will be home soon.

418
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,536
[doctor] This is him last week.

419
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:11,541
And there are the hippocampal
abnormalities we had discussed.

420
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,334
Nothing out of line with what we've seen

421
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,463
from others suffering
from post-traumatic stress. But...

422
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,924
this is Will from last night.

423
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,134
And as you can see,

424
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,929
there are now abnormalities
in the limbic and paralimbic areas.

425
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:25,889
And this...

426
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,976
is from an hour ago.

427
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,154
- [stutters] I don't hear any suggestions.
- We have bigger problems than the boy.

428
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,573
- Do we?
- We can't keep delaying the burn.

429
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,119
You're talking about putting... [stammers]
putting a Band-Aid on this.

430
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:51,331
- Right now, a Band-Aid is the best option.
- [doctor] It's our only option.

431
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,129
- And if it kills the boy?
- Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.

432
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,465
Say that to me again.

433
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,011
The rate this is spreading,
he'll be lost by the end of the day.

434
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,223
What we do or don't do
won't change the outcome.

435
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,891
We have to start the burn.

436
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,437
Where you going?

437
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,189
I'm going to think.

438
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,615
[Joyce] What the hell is taking so long?

439
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,242
[sighs]

440
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:33,581
Hey... doctors take forever, always.
Just try and relax. Just be patient.

441
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,919
- [exhales heavily]
- [monitor beeping]

442
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,554
[sighs and stammers] You know, I just...

443
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,727
[stammers] Let me through. Let me through!

444
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,688
- You know we can't do that.
- I need to talk to...

445
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,732
- He'll be with you shortly.
- You said that an hour ago.

446
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,734
[monitor beeping rapidly]

447
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,404
[indistinct chatter]

448
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,248
- [screeching]
- [Mike] Will.

449
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:17,709
Will? Will?

450
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,880
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?

451
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,256
[shuddering]

452
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,258
Uh...

453
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,634
I saw something.

454
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,096
In your now-memories?

455
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,310
The shadow monster.

456
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,355
I think I know how to stop him.

457
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,662
[Steve sighs]

458
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,832
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.

459
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,876
This will do just fine.

460
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,586
Good call, dude.

461
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,805
[Lucas] I said medium-well!

462
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,018
Who's that?

463
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,860
[Dustin] You told her?

464
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,695
- So what?
- "So what?"

465
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,906
- You wanted to tell her, too.
- But I didn't, all right?

466
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,742
We agreed not to tell her
and to look for Dart.

467
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,912
- Who you conveniently found.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying?

468
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,539
I'm saying you have
a creepy little bond with him.

469
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,917
Yeah, that was before
he turned into a Demogorgon.

470
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,877
- And you haven't heard from Mike?
- No.

471
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,170
- Or Will?
- No.

472
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,881
- Hopper?
- No! No one is around.

473
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,175
Why do you think
I'm with Steve Harrington?

474
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,011
- Something's...
- Wrong. I agree.

475
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,722
Which is why we need
as much help as we can get.

476
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,057
[Max grunting]

477
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,479
[Lucas] She didn't believe me anyway.

478
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,315
You probably didn't tell it right.

479
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,525
That must be it.

480
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,611
So, we good?

481
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,993
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one
helping me out is this random girl?

482
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,996
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go.
Let's go, I said!

483
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,498
- All right, asshole! God!
- Okay! Stupid.

484
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,976
What...

485
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,604
What is all of this?

486
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,900
[breathing heavily] I don't know.

487
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,986
Mom?

488
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,363
Will?

489
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,142
I don't shoot Polaroid.

490
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,770
- What?
- It's not mine.

491
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,314
Someone else has been here.

492
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,458
Sam, this is ludicrous.

493
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,794
- Just give him a moment, okay?
- We don't have time...

494
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,172
Hey, jackass, why don't you
do us all a favor and shut up, okay?

495
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,684
[Will] That's it.

496
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,813
That's what? What... what's there, Will?

497
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,065
I don't know.

498
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:14,070
I just know
he doesn't want me to see there.

499
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,240
I think it's important.

500
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,011
[door hisses]

501
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,223
[radar beeping]

502
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,145
Let's see if this kid's a wizard
or schizo, Doc.

503
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,608
First door on your right, gentlemen.

504
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:38,654
- [soldier 1] I'm guessing a ten.
- [soldier 2] Let's not overdo it now.

505
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,782
I read four.

506
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,868
Moving in.

507
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,287
[beeping]

508
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,303
[lighter clicking]

509
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,102
So you really fought
one of these things before?

510
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,482
And you're, like, totally,
100% sure it wasn't a bear?

511
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,652
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay?
It wasn't a bear.

512
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,946
Why are you even here
if you don't believe us?

513
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,240
Just go home.

514
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,327
Geesh. Someone's cranky.
Past your bedtime?

515
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,211
That's good. Just show her you don't care.

516
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,130
I don't.

517
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,509
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.

518
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,105
- [Max] It's kinda awesome.
- [Lucas] Huh?

519
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,732
[Max] The fog, I mean.

520
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,818
Looks like the ocean.

521
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,237
- You miss it?
- What?

522
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,741
The ocean. The waves? California?

523
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,789
- Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet.
- No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...

524
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,088
My dad's still there. So...

525
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,176
- Why?
- It's this legal term called "divorce."

526
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,762
See, when two married people
don't love each other anymore...

527
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,679
Yeah.

528
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,267
My mom and my stepdad,

529
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:18,898
they wanted a fresh start away from him.

530
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:24,695
As if... As if he was the problem,
which is total bull.

531
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,405
And things...

532
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,241
are just worse now.

533
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,869
My stepbrother's always been a dick,

534
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:37,583
but now he's just angry...
all the time and...

535
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,339
Well, he can't take it out
on my mom, so...

536
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,050
So he takes it out on you?

537
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,180
I don't even know
why I'm telling you this.

538
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:58,437
It's just... I know that I can be
a jerk like him sometimes,

539
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,984
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.

540
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,198
I guess I'm angry, too, and...

541
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,827
I'm sorry.

542
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,250
Jesus! What's wrong with me?

543
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,336
Hey. You're nothing
like your brother, okay?

544
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,799
You're cool and different.
And you're super smart.

545
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:31,053
- And you're, like, totally tubular.
- [chuckles]

546
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,598
- Nobody actually says that, you know.
- Well, I do now.

547
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,767
And it makes you seem really cool.

548
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,854
I like talking with you, Mad Max.

549
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,524
And I like talking with you, stalker.

550
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,110
[growling]

551
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,368
- You see him?
- No.

552
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,122
Lucas, what's going on?

553
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,248
[Lucas] Hold on!

554
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,296
[low growling]

555
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,382
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock!
[stutters] Ten o'clock!

556
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,051
There.

557
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,762
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

558
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,724
[low chittering]

559
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
- Wait. You sure that's not a dog?
- What?

560
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,396
[chittering continues]

561
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,065
He's not taking the bait.
Why is he not taking the bait?

562
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,234
Maybe he's not hungry?

563
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:30,154
Maybe he's sick of cow.

564
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,582
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?

565
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,083
Steve?

566
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,212
[breathing heavily]

567
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,379
Just get ready.

568
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,183
[metal creaking]

569
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,357

[whistling]

571
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,783
Come on, buddy.

572
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,327
[continues whistling]

573
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,999
- What's he doing?
- Expanding the menu.

574
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,876
[Steve] Come on, buddy.

575
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,505
Come on, buddy.

576
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,758
Come on. Dinner time.

577
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,345
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.

578
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,598
He's insane.

579
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,559
He's awesome.

580
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,832
Steve, watch out!

581
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,083
A little busy here!

582
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,378
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!

583
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,422
[growling]

00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,134
Steve!

585
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,555
Steve! Abort! Abort!

- Steve, run!
- Steve, hurry!

00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,482
Steve, run!

590
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,945
- [clamoring]
- Shit!

591
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,697
[Max] Are they rabid or something?

592
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,366
They can't get in! They can't!

593
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,702
- [monsters growling]
- [all screaming]

00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,794
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone!

00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,046
- [loud banging]
- Shit!

597
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,258
We're at the old junkyard,
and we are going to die!

00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,566
Out of the way! Out of the way!
You want some? Come get this!

00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,276

[low growling]

608
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,195
What happened?

609
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,905
I don't know.

610
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,907
- Steve scared 'em off?
- [Steve] No.

611
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,367
No way.

612
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,370
They're going somewhere.

613
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,720
- [tech] Almost there, ladies.
- Roger.

- [static]
- [radar beeping]

615
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,359
[soldier] All right, stay frosty, boys.

616
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,709
- Wait. That's where I was.
- What?

617
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,836
It's that damn graveyard.

618
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,976
[soldier] Sir, there's nothing here.

619
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,730
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.

620
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,568
[low growling]

621
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,411
[soldier] Got some kind of fog
moving in now.

622
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,667
[stammers] I'm sorry.

623
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,213
What? What do you mean, sweetie?

624
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,298
[shuddering]

625
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,716
He made me do it.

626
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,887
Who? Who made you do what?

627
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,889
I told you.

628
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,183
They upset him.

629
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,269
They shouldn't have done that.

630
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,272
They shouldn't have upset him.

631
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,150
The spy.

632
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,527
[cries]

633
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,945
The spy!

634
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,029
We've got movement.

635
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,365
You've got company, fellas.

[beeping]

637
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,159
Whoa, whoa!

638
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,078
I need to get through! It's a trap!

639
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,580
