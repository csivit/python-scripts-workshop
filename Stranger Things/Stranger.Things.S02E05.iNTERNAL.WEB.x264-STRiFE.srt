[creaking]

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,934
[Hopper] Hey, you reached Jim.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,812
I'm probably doing something incredible
right now, and I can't...

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,816
[sighs]

6
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,535
[Will] It's like... It's like I feel
what the shadow monster's feeling.

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,497
See what he's seeing.

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,373
Like in the Upside Down?

9
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,251
Some of him is there.

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,254
But some of him is here, too.

11
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:33,510
- Here, like, in this house?
- In this house and...

12
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,596
in me.

13
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,518
It's like... It's like he's reaching
into Hawkins more and more.

14
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,522
And the more he spreads,
the more connected to him I feel.

15
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,690
And the more you see these now-memories.

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:51,486
At first I just felt it
in the back of my head.

17
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,155
I didn't even really know it was there.

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,325
It's like when you have a dream

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,870
and you can't remember it
unless you think really hard.

20
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,914
It was like that.

21
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,208
But know it's like...

22
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:09,921
Now I remember. I remember all the time.

23
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,675
Maybe...

24
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,636
- Maybe that's good.
- Good?

25
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,263
Just think about it, Will.

26
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,349
You're like a spy now. A superspy.

27
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,851
Spying on the shadow monster.

28
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,855
If you know what he's seeing
and feeling...

29
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,482
maybe that's how we can stop him.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,319
Maybe all of this
is happening for a reason.

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,991
- You really think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I really do.

32
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,084
What if he figures out
we're spying on him?

33
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,838
- [sniffles] What if he spies back?
- He won't.

34
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,675
How do you know?

35
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,677
We won't let him.

36
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,811
[Hopper breathing heavily]

37
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,454

[theme music playing]

47
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,550
- [man 1] Hey.
- [man 2] Hey. Did you get 'em?

48
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,634
[man 1] Yeah.

[song playing on stereo]

We'd like a... uh, a room.

52
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,541
We got those.

53
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,253
You want a single or a double?

54
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,421
[both] Double.

55
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,342

Nance...

57
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,691
- Uh, on or off?
- Hmm.

58
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,403
- What?
- Nothing. Just...

59
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,365
déjà vu.

60
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,449
[chuckles softly]

61
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,036
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle softly]

62
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,997
Don't you think it's weird?

63
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,707
What?

64
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,585
How we only seem to hang out
when the world's about to end?

65
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,920
It's not going to end.

66
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,840
Feels like it. [sighs]

67
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,805
Still have yours?

68
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,517
- [Jonathan] Yeah.
- Mmm...

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,644
- Yeah, mine's bigger.
- [chuckles]

70
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,480
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

[sighs]

72
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,250
What happened?

73
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,878
What do you mean?

74
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
To us?

75
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,927
After everything, you just...

76
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,848
disappeared.

77
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,227

78
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,354
Yeah, Will needed me.

And Steve...

80
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,405
I waited.

81
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,074
Yeah, like, only a month.

82
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,209
[Nancy] I want them off.

[Will] Mom?

86
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,792
Mom?

87
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,461
- Mom?
- [gasps] Yeah?

88
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,590
- I saw him.
- You saw who, baby?

89
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,800
Hopper.

90
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,553
I think he's in trouble.

91
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,098
I think he's going to die.

- Uh-uh.

103
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,004
- Dad?
- Mmm-hmm?

104
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,467
When Mom's mad at you,
how do you make her not mad?

105
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,929
Hmm. That's a great question.
How do you, hon?

106
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,098
[Mr. Sinclair] First, I apologize.

107
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,434
Then, I get your mother
whatever she wants.

108
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,936
Even when she's wrong?

109
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,730
She's never wrong, son.

110
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,775
That's right. [chuckles]

111
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,238
- Not hungry?
- [Lucas] Not really.

Where you goin'?

113
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,119
To hang out with Dustin.

114
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,581
[softly] Sorry.

she's not in your room?

If you'd like to make a call...

Thank you so much,
Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much.

123

You are a true lifesaver.

They found her?

129
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,049
No. But they saw her wandering
around Loch Nora.

00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,303
[crying] How did the poor baby
get all the way out there?

131
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,014
I don't know. Lost, I guess.
But they're gonna look for her.

132
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,349
And I'll stay here,
just in case they call again.

133
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,269
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah?

134

Give me hug.
Give me a hug. Go get her.

- Okay.

00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,800
All right, "Five-fifteen." Sure.

168
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,054
Thank you.

169
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,014
Hey.

170
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,934
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?

171
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,560
Must be scared half to death.

172
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,229
How long's it been?

173
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,856
Long time.

174
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,054
[breathing heavily]

175
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,850

[knocks on door]

177
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,696
[Becky] Go away! I'm not interested!

178
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,746
Look, I don't want your Thin Mints,
all right, kid?

179
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,416
- Thin Mints?
- Or your religious mumbo jumbo.

180
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,876
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, okay?

181
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,975
[creaking]

182
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,939
I want to see Mama.

183
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:10,320
Name a way you occupy your time
when you're having a boring day at work.

184
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,156
[buzzer rings]

185
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,284
- [man] Drink coffee.
- [host] "Drink coffee," said Mike.

186
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,620
- [bell dings]
- Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.

187
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,456
[Lynn] Visit with other employees.

188
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,875
- [host] "Visit with other employees."
- Rainbow.

189
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,168
- [bell dings]
- [applause]

190
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,754
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Mama?

191
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,049
Breathe. Sunflower.

192
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,216
Rainbow.

193
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,803
- Three to the right. Four to the left.
- Mama, can you hear me?

194
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,264
Four-fifty. Breathe.

195
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,059
Sunflower.

196
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:41,810
Rainbow.

197
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,064
Mama? It's me...

198
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,192
Jane.

199
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,236
I'm here now.

200
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:01,413
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow. Four-fifty.

201
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,792
Breathe. Sunflower.

202
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,376
- What's wrong with Mama?
- Rainbow.

203
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,254
- Four-fifty.
- [crying]

[song stops]

206
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,312
[Jonathan] Are you positive
this is the right place?

207
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,565
"3833." Yeah.

208
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,527
All right.

209
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,288
[train horn blaring in the distance]

210
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,669
[buzzes]

211
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,879
[Murray] Look at the camera.

212
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,134
- The camera.
- [Jonathan] What camera?

213
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:59,179
[Murray] Not the loudspeaker.
Above you, to the right.

214
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,683
[door rattles]

215
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:09,773
Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers.
You two are a long way from home.

216
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,870
Well...

217
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,915
I hope you didn't come all this way
to tell me about the bear

218
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,084
in the Harrington kid's backyard.

219
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,587
I've heard that one already.

220
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,268
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.

221
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,192
I followed up on 200 tips,

222
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,570
most bogus, but that's how
these things always go, okay?

223
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,115
I know every last step
Barbara took that day,

224
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,075
every last person she talked to.

225
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,078
The answer to what happened
to your friend, it's up here somewhere.

226
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,041
I assure you that.
I just gotta connect the right dots.

227
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,542
Timeline's wrong.

228
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
I'm sorry?

229
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,464
Your timeline is wrong.

230
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:21,470
And the girl with the buzzed hair,
she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab.

231
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,263
Her name was Eleven.

232
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,557
You might wanna sit down for this.

233

- [rock song playing on stereo]
- [engine revving]

234
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,400
If you're not out in an hour...

235
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,154
- Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know.
- Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.

236
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,367
[tires screeching]

- [indistinct chatter]
- [video games beeping]

238
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,254
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.

239
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
What happened?

240
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,592
Short circuit in the motherboard.
A real bummer.

241
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,679
But fret not. I got another machine
up and running in the back.

242
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,101
Hold these.

243
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,283
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.

244
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,034
- I told you I would.
- [grunts]

245
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,496
And keep things PG in here, all right?

246
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,583
[door closes]

247
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,210
What is this shit, stalker?

248
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,838
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.

249
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,465
A safe place to what? Be creepy?

250
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,802
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth
about everything that happened last year.

251
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,513
But if anyone finds out,
you could be arrested.

252
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,641
[sighs] Possibly killed.

253
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,352
- Killed?
- I need to know.

254
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,397
Do you accept the risk?

255
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,527
- Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid.
- Do you accept the risk?

256
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,030
Yeah.

257
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,781
Sure. Fine.

258
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,700
I accept the risk.

259
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,582
Let's hear it.

260
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,168
Last year...

261
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,422
Will didn't get lost in the woods.

262
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,761
He got lost somewhere else.

263
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,144
[thunder rumbling]

264
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,316
Hey, is this where you saw him?
[stutters] Is this where you saw Hopper?

265
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,234
I think so. Yeah.

266
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,236
[softly] Okay.

267
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,377
[Mike] Here!

268
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,471
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?

269
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,682
Yeah. Now we just need to find out
where here is, right?

270
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,683
Right.

271
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,394
Did he say anything?
I mean, before he left?

272
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,648
[sighs] Uh, some... something about vines?

273
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,150
- [car approaching]
- Hopper.

274
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,914
Surprise. I would've called,
but you said not to clog up the line.

275
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,959
You know, I... We're fine,
we don't need anything.

276
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,921
When I was sick as a kid,
and I was sick all the time as a kid,

277
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,174
nothing made me feel better
than focusing on these brain teasers.

278
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,677
Those are great. Ah...

279
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,928
I could teach him how to play.

280
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,305
- You know, he's sleeping.
- [thunder rumbling]

281
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,015
Okay.

282
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,226
I could wait with you?

283
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,146
[sighs] Listen, it's just not a good time.

284
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,023
But, um, you know what?
I'll call you, okay?

285
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,650
Thank you.

286
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,735
- You sure?
- Yeah.

287
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,738
Well, have him call me. They don't call me
Bob the Brain for nothing.

288
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,031
[chuckles]

289
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,452
[gasps] Bob!

290
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:16,997
That's my name.

291
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,673
Huh.

292
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,551
Hmm.

293
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,471
- You drew all these yourself?
- [Joyce] Mmm-hmm.

294
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,768
- Why, exactly?
- I... I told you the rules.

295
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,396
- No questions, okay?
- Yeah.

296
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,482
We... we just need you
to help us figure out what...

297
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,526
Bob? Bob?

298
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
Over here.

299
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,784
Where... where this is.

300
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,953
That's the objective. Find the X.

301
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,623
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?
[chuckles]

302
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,499
Bob, no questions.

303
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,460
Okay.

304
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,631
- [sighs and clicks tongue]
- [Joyce clears throat]

305
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,633
Let me talk to you for a second.
Hang on, guys.

306
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,221
Joyce, you can talk to me.
You know that, right?

307
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:18,433
[stammers] Yeah.
What's the problem, exactly?

308
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,643
What's the problem?

309
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,897
Joyce, [sighs] Will doesn't look well.

310
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,565
You don't look well.

311
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,566
What's going on?

312
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,360
Nothing. Nothing.

313
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,403
Is this an episode?
Is this one of Will's episodes?

314
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,614
No. No! No. [scoffs]

315
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,575
[stutters] I'm sorry. I just... I don't...

316
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,828
see how any of this is good for Will,
or for you.

317
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,249
And even if I wanted to play along,
I mean, how could I figure anything out

318
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,167
if I don't understand
the context of the game?

319
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,502
[thunder rumbling]

320
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,254
- Or...
- What?

321
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,257
- What is it?
- I know that shape.

322
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,384
It's Lovers' Lake.

323
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,639
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.

324
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,975
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.

325
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,853
And if that's Lake Jordan,
then you can probably find...

326
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,773
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.

327
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,442
And if you just follow it naturally...

328
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,361
it moves to...

329
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,697
the Eno River.

330
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,075
And there it is.
That's the Eno, do you see it?

331
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:20,453
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.

332
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,205
But they act like roads.

333
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,916
And they act like roads 'cause when you
follow 'em, you'll see...

334
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,751
they don't go over water.

335
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,754
And that's the giveaway.
That's the giveaway. Ha!

336
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,256
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,

337
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,091
it's a map.

338
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,011
It's a map of Hawkins.

339
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,929
[Bob laughs]

340
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,182
Right, Will?

341
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,731
[squealing]

342
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,982
[radio static]

343
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,317
[Hopper] Does anybody copy?

344
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,779
Look, if anybody copies,
this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...

345
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,865
[radio static]

346
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,367
[panting]

347
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,843
[Hopper gasps]

348
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,599
[breathing heavily]

349
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,273
[screeching]

350
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,080
[grunts]

351
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,253
[screeching]

352
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,300
[grunting]

353
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,390
[continues grunting]

354
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,027
Guys, this is Dustin again.

355
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,407
Does anyone copy? This is a code red.
I repeat, a code red!

356
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,910
I really need someone to pick up here.

357
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,289
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.

358
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,250
Code red!

359
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,293
All right, it's Dustin again.

360
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,795
Seriously, I have a code red.

361
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,172
Could you please shut up?

362
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,007
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?

363
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:41,136
- Where is he?
- Don't know. Don't care.

364
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,303
[stutters] Is he with Mike?

365
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,974
Like I said,
I don't know and I don't care.

366
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,853
Please tell him it's super important.
Please tell him that I have a code...

367
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,020
Code red?

368
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,314
- Yep, code red. Exactly.
- Mmm-hmm.

369
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,567
I got a code for you instead.

370
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,903
It's called code shut-your-mouth.

371
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,656
[radio static]

372
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,741
[stutters] Erica?

373
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,163
[Becky] I just need a little help
understanding, sweetie, okay?

374
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:13,543
Can you tell me where you came from?

375
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:17,213
- Where you've been all this time?
- [TV playing indistinctly]

376
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,095
A policeman and a woman
came looking for you last year.

377
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,556
Did they find you?

378
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,183
She won't get better...

379
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,478
will she?

380
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,148
They don't think so, no.

381
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,277
[sniffles] But she's not in any pain.

382
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,822
She's just stuck, they think.

383
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,033
Like in a dream.

384
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,494
A long dream.

385
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,996
A good dream?

386
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,624
I hope so.

387
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,792
[Eleven sighs]

388
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,629
Is it the same dream?

389
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,632
[Becky] We don't know.

390
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,134
Sometimes she says different words.

391
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,719
But usually those.

392
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,139
[cries softly]

393
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,645
She always believed
that you were out there.

394
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,690
She always believed
that you'd come home one day.

395
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,653
Home?

396
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,071
Yeah, home.

397
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,116
[Eleven sniffles]

398
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,328
[door creaking]

399
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,198
Pretty.

400
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:12,203
I can get you a real bed,
and you can stay here with me

401
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,288
if you want.

402
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,081
How's that sound?

403
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:26,342
I wanna help you, but to really do that,
I need you to talk to me, okay?

404
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,596
Doesn't have to be now.
Doesn't have to be today.

405
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:31,931
But when you're ready.

406
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,725
Okay?

407
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,855
Okay.

408
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,238
[Becky] Oh, yeah, that.

409
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,116
That happens sometimes.

410
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,368
Old house, bad wiring...

411
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,831
Or if you ask
my crazy aunt Shirley, it's...

412
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,667
haunted.

413
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,769
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.

414
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,853
No.

415
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,574
[muttering indistinctly]

416
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,162
It's Mama.

417
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,958
Sunflower. Rainbow.

418
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,544
Three to the right. Four to the left.

419
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,546
[stutters] I don't understand.

420
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,674
Four-fifty.

421
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,842
She knows I'm here.

422
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,221
[TV channels changing]

423
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,401
She wants to talk.

424
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,361
Rainbow.

425
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,698
- [static hissing]
- [Terry speaking indistinctly]

426
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,326
[Bob] All right.

427
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,082
All right. I'm 3.6 inches,
what do you got?

428
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,042
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?

429
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,252
Hold on.

430
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:34,262
- Twenty-one feet, four inches.
- What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?

431
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,098
[sighs and stammers] Danford?
Where's Danford?

432
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,141
Dining room.

433
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
[sighs] Sixteen feet, ten inches.

434
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,605
What about Danford to Jordan?

435
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,442
Oh, come on.
[stuttering] This has gotta be enough.

436
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
It's not. It's... it's really not.

437
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,404
Okay. Can't you figure it out?

438
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,115
[stuttering] Well, it's hard.
The ratio isn't exactly one-to-one.

439
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,201
I mean, if you're twisting my arm,
and you are twisting my arm,

440
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,163
I would say that the X is...

441
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,626
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?

442
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,129
[sighs] Thank you. Thank you.

443
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,010
What? Are we... we really going?

444
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,517
[Karen] I don't know, Cath.

445
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,103
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher,
that'd be another story.

446
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,855
[doorbell ringing]

447
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,690
Just a second, Cath.

448
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,069
Ted, can you get that please?

449
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,905
Sorry.

450
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,407
I got it.

451
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,122
Your line has been busy
for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler.

452
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,333
- Do you realize this?
- Oh, I do realize.

453
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,126
- Is Mike home?
- No.

454
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,420
No? Well, where the hell is he?

455
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,464
Karen, where's our son?

456
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,715
Will's!

457
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,051
- Will's.
- [sighs] No one's picking up there.

458
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,803
Nancy. What about Nancy?

459
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,805
Karen, where's Nancy?

460
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,765
- [sighs] Ally's!
- Ally's.

461
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,310
Our children don't live here anymore.
You didn't know that?

462
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,771
- Seriously?
- Am I done here?

463
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,732
Son of a bitch. You're really no help
at all, you know that?

464
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,567
[Ted] Hey! Language.

465
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,333
Listen...

466
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,001
I've been thinking...

467
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,003
I love you. I'm sorry.

468
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,005
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?

469
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:34,090
Steve.

470
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,300
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?

471
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,885
- No.
- Good.

472
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,179
- Hey. What the hell? Hey!
- Nancy isn't home.

473
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,806
- Where is she?
- Doesn't matter.

474
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,850
We have bigger problems
than your love life.

475
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,017
Do you still have that bat?

476
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,353
- Bat? What bat?
- The one with the nails?

477
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,480
- Why?
- I'll explain it on the way.

478
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,400
- Now?
- Now!

479
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,485

00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,525
[muffled screaming]

492
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,990
[Lucas] And that was the last
we ever saw of her.

493
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,035
After that, she was just gone.

494
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,914
I can't believe it's been that long.
Feels like yesterday.

495
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,833
Yeah. I mean, I bet.

496
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,294
- Wow.
- It's crazy.

497
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,129
[sighs] I know.

498
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,714
It's crazy, but...

499
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,926
I really liked it.

500
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,637
- Liked it?
- Yeah.

501
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,556
- Well, I mean, I had a few issues.
- Issues?

502
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,350
I felt it was a little derivative
in parts.

503
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,685
What are you talking about?

504
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,687
I just wish it had
a little more originality.

505
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,313
- That's all.
- You don't believe me?

506
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,567
Lucas, come on, seriously?
How gullible do you think I am?

507
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,819
Why would I make this up?

508
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:05,574
I don't know. To impress me or something?
Or you're just, like, insane.

509
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,744
I tell you all of this.
I mean, top-secret stuff.

510
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,372
Risking my life.
And this is how you react?

511
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,040
[chuckles] Risking your life?

512
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,918
- Oh, so this is funny to you?
- Yeah. I mean...

513
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,795
kind of funny.

514
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,299
Stupid, but funny.

515
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,384
Where are you going?

516
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,429
Story time's over, isn't it?

517
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,766
[indistinct chatter]

518
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,394
What's wrong with you?
I gave you what you wanted.

519
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,896
I wanted to be a part of the group,
not a part of some joke.

520
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,189
It's not a joke.

521
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,983
You did a good job, okay?

522
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,901
You can go tell the others
I believed your lies

523
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,862
if it gets you experience points
or whatever.

524
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,405
[sighs]

525
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,158
We have a lot of rules in our party,

526
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,202
but the most important is,
"Friends don't lie."

527
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,288
Never ever. No matter what.

528
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,372
Is that right?

529
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,792
Then how do you explain this?

530
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,713
[sighs] I had to do that. To protect you.

531
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,049
To protect me from who, exactly?

532
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,468
The big bad government baddies
from Hawkins Lab?

533
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:06,552
Lower your voice.

534
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,680
Maybe it was to protect me from
the Demogorgon from another dimension?

535
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,390
- Max, I'm serious, shut up!
- Oh, no, no!

536
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,517
You know what it was?
It was Eleven. The girl...

537
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,228
Stop talking.

538
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,565
You're going to get us killed.

539
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,984
Do you understand?

540
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,030
You're serious?

541
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,033
I really wish I wasn't.

542
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,078
Prove it.

543
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,622
I can't.

544
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,540
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?

545
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:37,833
Yes.

546
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,878
- [car engine revving]
- [tires screeching]

547
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,884
Shit. I gotta go. Um...

548
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,346
Don't follow me out. Okay?

549
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,973
Do you believe me?

550
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,644
[rock song playing on stereo]

551
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,191
The hell I tell you?

552
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,734
I'm not late.

553
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,361
You know what I'm talking about.

554
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,031
- Oh, Lucas?
- [scoffs]

555
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,992
- So he has a name now, huh?
- [stammers]

556
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,203
It's a small town, okay?
We weren't hanging out.

557
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,498
Hmm. Well, you know
what happens when you lie.

558
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,708
I'm not lying.

559
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,639
[Owens on tape]
What if they try to replicate that?

560
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,349
The more attention we bring to ourselves,

561
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,726
the more people like the Hollands
who know the truth,

562
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,728
the more likely that scenario becomes.

563
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,481
You see why I have to stop
the truth from spreading, too.

564
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,569
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.

565
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,778
[tape recorder clicks]

566
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,032
So, is it enough?

567
00:40:55,202 --> 00:41:00,166
The tape recording, is it enough?
[stutters] Is it incriminating?

568
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,225
[liquid pouring]

569
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,602
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

570
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,728
With vodka?

571
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,273
It's a central nervous system depressant.
So yes, with vodka.

572
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,491
[Nancy] Music? Really?

573
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,534
Yes. It helps me...

574
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,579
- [Jonathan] What? Think?
- [sighs heavily]

575
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,711
[jazz song playing]

576
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,138
How long is this gonna take?

577
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
Longer if you keep talking.

578
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,810
Is the tape incriminating or not?
It's a simple question.

579
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,312
[laughs]

580
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,147
There's nothing simple about it.

581
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,857
Nothing simple about anything
you've told me.

582
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,400
You don't believe us, do you?

583
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,444
I believe you, but that's not the problem.

584
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,906
You don't need me to believe you.
You need them to believe you.

585
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,282
- Them?
- Them.

586
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,493
With a capital "T."

587
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:23,707
Your priest, your postman, your teacher,
the world at large. [scoffs]

588
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,084
They won't believe any of this.

589
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,169
That's why we made the tape.

590
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,339
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.

591
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,759
He admits it. You heard it.
He admits culpability.

592
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,594
You're being naive, Nancy!

593
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,221
Those people...

594
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,389
[chuckles]

595
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,517
They're not wired like me and you, okay?

596
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,813
They don't spend their lives trying to get
a look at what's behind the curtain.

597
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
[chuckles] They like the curtain.

598
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,277
It provides them stability,
comfort, definition.

599
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
This...

600
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,405
this would open the curtain,

601
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,032
and open the curtain
behind that curtain, okay?

602
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:02,037
So the minute someone
with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,

603
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:07,626
everyone will nod their heads and say,
"See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."

604
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,212
That is, if you even get
their attention at all.

605
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,047
You're saying we did all of this
for nothing?

606
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,383
I'm saying, I'm thinking.

607
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,971
Ooh!

608
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,307
[grunts]

609
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,773
[Jonathan] This is ridiculous.

610
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,193
- That's it. That's it!
- What's it?

611
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,363
It's just too strong. Too strong.

612
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,368
Better.

613
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,753
Perfect.

614
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,173
We water it down.

615
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:57,134
- Precisely.
- Wait. What?

616
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,179
Your story. We moderate it.

617
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,891
Just like this drink here.

618
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,935
We make it more tolerable.

619
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:14,526
Perhaps Barbara was exposed
to some dangerous toxins.

620
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,155
A leak from the lab.
Like Three Mile Island or something.

621
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,075
Something scary but familiar.

622
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,704
Close enough that it hits the man
right where it hurts.

623
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,499
And those assholes that killed Barb...

624
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,875
They'll go down.

625
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,877
[takes deep breath]

626
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,425
[Owens] All right, what are we looking at?

627
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,886
[lab technician] This was some of the soil
we took yesterday.

628
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,306
Okay. So what is your concern?

629
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,309
Well, we didn't find
any signs of contamination.

630
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,020
Uh, nothing hazardous
other than some pesticides.

631
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,438
Well, it's a farm.

632
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,108
Right, right. Exactly. But...

633
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,514
Like this?

634
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,142
Yes.

635
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,936
[static hissing]

636
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,940
It's okay if I sit here, right?

637
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,067
Yes.

638
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,528
[stammers] And I won't mess it up
or anything?

639
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,863
- No.
- Okay.

640
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,325
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her
that I love her very much?

641
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,494
And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe...

642
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,955
- Stop talking.
- Okay, sorry.

643
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,878
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

644
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,755
Three to the right. Four to the left.

645
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,674
Four-fifty.

646
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,010
Breathe.

647
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,639
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.

648
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,477
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Four-fifty.

649
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,354
- Breathe.
- Mama?

650
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:18,442
- Sunflower. Rainbow.
